        <p><b>History of Chandpur:</b> It was upgraded to Chandpur district on 15 February 1984.
            During the reign of the Bar Bhuiyans, the Chandpur region was occupied by <b>Chand Roy</b>, the zamindar of Bikrampur. He established a centre of government in this region. According to historian JM Sengupta, the region was named Chandpur after Chand Roy. <br>
            
            On the other hand, the area is named Chandpur after <b>Chand Fakir</b> of Purindapur Mahalla of Chandpur town (Koralia). According to some, an administrator named <b>Shah Ahmed Chand</b> came here from Delhi in the fifteenth century and established a river port. Chandpur is named after him. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Branding City:</b> As one of the breeding areas of Hilsa fish, Chandpur is called as the <b>'Home of Hilsa'</b>. <br>
            <b>Abdus Sabur Mandal</b>, the then Deputy Commissioner, started the district branding activities from August 2015 to present Chandpur especially at home and abroad. In keeping with Hilsa, he gave its branding name, <b>City of Hilsa</b>. In 2016, it recognized Chandpur as the first branding district in the country. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Tourist areas:</b> Chandpur is one of the riverine districts. <b>'Boro Station'</b>, the meeting place of Padma, Meghna and Dakatia, is one of the tourist areas of Chandpur. The Boro Station is better known to tourists as the estuary of three rivers. There is a hilsa fish market next to the big station. During the hilsa season, tourists from different parts of the country flock there to see the hilsa fish. And for eating fried fresh hilsa. Not only the warehouse but also the hilsa can be seen around the city during the hilsa season. <br>
            In addition to the Boro Station, near Chandpur, the awakened char <b>'Mini Cox's Bazar'</b> is now the main tourist attraction. <br>
            Besides, there is <b>'Rupsha Zamidar Bari'</b> of Faridganj Upazila. The house stands as a unique example of zamidars. That is why the attraction of tourists is increasing day by day with the house. <br>
            Then there is <b>'Lohagarh Moth'</b> in Chandra area of ​​Chandpur. Tourists come to Chandpur in almost all seasons to see this historical place at a maximum distance of 10 km from Chandpur. This Lohagarh Moth is a unique example of history. And who is not interested in knowing that history? <br>
            There is no shortage of natural beauty in Chandpur. Chandpur is getting new outfits to welcome the tourists day by day. And the local administration is working day by day with new plans to make Chandpur tourist-dependent.</p>
